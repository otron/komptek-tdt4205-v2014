=====================

Exercise/Assignment solutions for the course "TDT4205 Compiler Design" during the spring semester of 2014 at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science. Bitches go completely nuts over this.

And I mean like, you ever seen a squirrel eat nuts?
Me neither.
I don't think that's what "go [completely] nuts" refers to.
Squirrels eating nuts, that is.
It's probably got more to do with "nuts" being a metaphor or term or whatever for "crazy" as in "to be crazy about something".
Not as in "mad".

Anyway here's a video of a squirrel eating a de-shelled walnut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4HVi5otbpc

You know what else is weird?
That I've got this idea that squirrels eat nuts and mostly nuts.
They also eat cones, which is what I should be associating them with.
'Cause you typically find squirrel-ravaged cones all around squirrel-infested areas in Norway.
You don't see the squirrels as often as you do the ravaged cones though.
Here's a video of a squirrel eating a pine cone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnjFwvSZ2G8
